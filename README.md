# landingpage_pampamed
Proposed landing page for Pampamed focused on minimalism and responsive design.

This is a simple HTML/CSS landing page for a company, that showcases responsive and minimalist design.
I also included a conceptual version of the landing page, with the same information presented in a more professional and elegant style.
